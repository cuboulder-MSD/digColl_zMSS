While waiting for all of the attendees to arrive, Rabbi Zalman leads the group in a chant and proceeds to explain each verse of the chant. After everyone has arrived, Rabbi Zalman asks the question which provides impetus for the seminar--what is the payoff in life? He states it is to be able to look back and say it was worth it and that we learn and can give back to the global brain. As an introduction to the morning learning, Rabbi Zalman sings Psalm 23 in Hebrew. He then introduces Barry Barkhan who defines the role of an elder in society and discusses the creation of an ""Elder's Guild."" After the definition, Rabbi Zalman delves into a deeper discussion of eldering and how individuals can assume credible positions as an elder within their community. The rest of the video contains two short attendee meditations, small group discussion, and full group discussion. In addition, Rabbi Zalman provides a short biography of his life responding to an audience question.","","Aging","LCSH","Well-being--Age factors","LCSH","Spirituality","LCSH","Older people","LCSH","Judaism","LCSH","","","Jewish renewal","LCSH","Spiritual Eldering Institute","Local","Spirituality","LCSH","Jewish renewal","LCSH","","","","","Moving image","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi Collection","Special Collections, Archives & Preservation, University of Colorado Boulder","Local","","Phoenix (Ariz.)","LCNAF","","","Schachter-Shalomi, Zalman, 1924-2014","Presenter","Barry Barkhan, Barry","","","","","","","","","","","","","Barkhan, Barry","Contributor","","","","","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

Rabbi Zalman then moves into a discussion of affirmation, prayer, and liturgy--citing the Kedusha (a Hebrew prayer) as an example of affirmation in liturgical text.

Rabbi Zalman then cites Psalm 100 in reference to the notion that individuals do not make themselves, but instead that God makes people and people belong to God. After this discussion Rabbi Zalman has candles lit and cedar burned to set a tone for the evening prayer service. He begins with Hashkivenu, then moves onto chanting Orech Yamim (Psalms 91:16), and then requests that seven attendees come up and share their experiences from the seminar. After individuals share, Rabbi Zalman returns to conclude the seminar. The audio is very low and choppy. He concludes by discussing a way of going to bed, citing common pre-bedtime liturgy including Psalms 19:15, the Shema (a central prayer in Judaism), a single line which is commonly repeated three times, and Adon Olam. In closing, all of the attendees form a huddle in the middle of the room and chant in English.

The video begins with an introduction to the concept of Spiritual Eldering and introduces several potential issues that arise for elders. Rabbi Zalman discusses the notion of psychoprophylaxis and extends the concept to preparing for death. He then moves into a discussion of the tools for Spiritual Eldering. After a discussion of the tools, he asks the participants to have a 10 minute discussion on moving from aging to sage-ing.

He then has the participants perform socialized meditation. After the meditation, Rabbi Zalman moves into a discussion of what participants should expect and strive for after the workshop. Finally, there is a long period of question and answer between him and the participants and the video ends with Rabbi Zalman singing a nigun (a melody sung with repetitious phonemes and not words) and a brief comment on Jewish Renewal.
This video has some audio issues for the first 15 minutes and only the right channel of sound is present throughout the video aside from some very brief, intermittent left channel audio at the beginning of the recording.

The first five minutes consist of a message regarding politics and urges his teachers to go out and spread their knowledge. The video then goes dark and comes back on to another message. This time Rabbi Zalman is speaking to teachers regarding how they should conduct themselves while teaching. He urges them to teach up to their students and not down. He asks that they embrace compassion over judgement. Rabbi Zalman states that the most important aspect of teaching should be that it comes from a place of love. It is only through this method that the lesson will be absorbed by the students. He has the teachers meditate with him in order to bring them to the headspace they should be in while teaching. The video ends on him reading an excerpt from, ""The Dream Assembly,"" and cuts out mid story.

The interview takes place in Tecate, Mexico on the Jewish Holiday of Sukkot in a Sukkah (a structure built for Sukkot). The interview has an overarching theme of the unification of global thought and spirituality. While both Zalman and Eve have similar responses to questions, they both come from different backgrounds which color their beliefs. There is discussion of the collective need for spirituality, healing, and merging the teachings of east, west, and other mythologies. Rabbi Zalman notes that each tradition is still important as they all have their own teachings to offer. Both he and Eve discuss the similarities between cultures and how their search is for an underlying truth.They also both discuss the theme of the next Wisdom School--the messianic era--and both reflect back on how impactful the previous two wisdom schools have been.

Zalman discusses the benefits and drawbacks of tradition and Smith continues the discussion. There are mentions and a short discussion relating to Ram Dass and Timothy Leary. Finally, Smith brings up the idea that no one religion contains more truth than another. They finish by bringing up the question of: How do we decide how much tradition to maintain and how much to eschew?

In the second interview, Zalman addresses the notion that Jewish Renwal is Judaism-lite. His belief is that this is far from the truth. Throughout the interview he discusses: the entire global community being one, Jewish Renewal's focus on oneness, making a Noah’s ark for Judaism — saving aspects from all Jewish groups, a focus on how Jews pray, his history from the Lubovitch community to obtaining his doctorite at Hebrew Union College (Reform movement affiliated), the need to reintigrate Kabbalah into Judaism, the necessary inclusion of women, the LGBT community, intermarried couples, and non-Jews, and how Jewish Renewal views Israel.

He discusses creation in the framework of Kabbalah. Additionally, he discusses the difficulty in Hebrew to English translation and its affect on how people understand texts. Zalman then moves into a discussion of Torah, Midrash, and davening (praying). Near the middle of the video he provides a lengthy explanation of Shiva Asar B’Tamuz (a minor Jewish fast day, lit. Seventeenth of Tamuz). For the last 50 minutes, Zalman jumps from topic to topic discussing: The Messiah, the four levels of interpretation, the four worlds, and Halacha (Jewish Law) versus Aggada (Legend).

Finally, he discusses human connectivity to God, Sefirot and their intersection with the four worlds, and the need to stay grounded in order for Kabbalah to help.

The first segment is a birthday message from Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi to Ma Jaya. He wishes her well and sings a Mi Sheberach (healing prayer) to the tune of happy birthday. He finishes her message with blowing the shofar (rams horn). After the message, there is near 30 minutes of no video. The video picks up with a documentary on a Star-K (Kosher Certification) slaughterhouse in Colorado. The documentary chronicles the creation, and problems faced, in the creation of the Kosher meat co-op.

The video opens with Zalman asking participants what their agendas are for the day. He then proceeds to lead the group in songs and explains why they are singing. After a few songs, Zalman has the participants sit in pairs and do an exercise where they recite lines to each other. After the exercise, he asks for feedback and then has the participants pair up again and do another exercise. Then Zalman explains Hitbodedut (self-secluded meditation made famous by Reb Nachman of Bratslav) and how to do it. He has the participants go outside to practice this type of meditation. After hitbodedut, the participants return to the classroom and Zalman spends the rest of the video discussing aspects of the Sefirot. The video ends abruptly in the middle of Zalman speaking.

Joseph provides an excellent chronology of his families experiences and their context within the surrounding environment. He discusses fleeing Vienna and becoming a refugee who lived in Antwerp, multiple locations in France, and then settling in New York with his family in 1941.

He starts by discussing origins of the current consciousness. He presents the evolution of models—Sigmund Freud, Behaviorism, Carl Jung, Humanistic Psychology, Viktor Frankl, and Transpersonal Psychology. He says we are still missing something: the realization of our connectedness. Something happens when there’s a group energy. He talks of thought form created by a group of people in Tibet-- that with a certain focus of energy a different field of form is created. Could a morphogenetic field be constructed with intent? He talks of other planes of being. He quotes the work of Swedenborg’s Heaven and Hell and Maximus Homo, and the body of god having many parts. We know about these morphogenetic fields, that there are beings on other vibratory levels. We must shift the template of society, create places where people can meet and learn upaya. He talks of Osho, Peyote ritual people, the sweat lodge, and night services he conducted in the 1960s. He talks of share flow and posits the world being in this state. When conflicts aggregate something new emerges. We can shape this—we can do lifecraft on the emerging aggregates. He talks of eye contact meditations and making this sharing happen. When we are processing, we could learn how to get on one frequency. He mentions Ken Wilbur and his work on what keeps smaller groups together. He discusses psychic research and what happens in telepathy. Parapsychology studies have been done on individuals but what results we would get with groups—a possible amplification of current? He talks of Baal Shem Tov and Michael Hutchison and the brain mind technology; training the brain in different states of being. This has been done with individuals, but what would happen with groups? Would it enhance telepathy? He would like to see retreats like compassion stretchers. People grab initiative from you-- what is or may not your task. He says we need to have mediums to read us and screen us in such situations. He suggests working with the zodiac circle. Separate people by zodiac and breathe together. Is there more harmony? Can we send currents upstream to slow the current of time?","","Transpersonal psychology","LCSH","Telepathy","LCSH","Consciousness","LCSH","Brain stimulation","LCSH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Moving image","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi Collection","Special Collections, Archives & Preservation, University of Colorado Boulder","Local","","Boulder (Colo.)","LCNAF","","","Schachter-Shalomi, Zalman, 1924-2014","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

He discusses angels. When we do something good and have good intention, we create an angel. Angels bring lessons that come to us on many levels. He talks about levels of attunement, a grateful mentality, and how moving across these levels raises our consciousness. He discusses perpetual adoration, quieting, thankfulness and blessings-- and gives examples of these in various prayers.

"","narv_zalman_135_15_rabbiZalmanSchacterNoonLectureSeries030498_a.mp4","","Rabbi Zalman Schacter Noon Lecture Series","Rabbi Schachter-Shalomi is introduced. He quotes Ocatvio Paz: Life is plurality. Death is uniformity. By eliminating cultures life is weakened. Every culture that disappears diminishes life. We must clear the reductive method template from our minds. We cannot cut a thing out. We must see it organismically-- we need one another. Everything is in a community, from the smallest electron; everything is in relation to each other. The chain of life is accomplished by a chain of consciousness. Organisms live in community. Cells talk to each together, which indicates consciousness. If there is an intelligence greater than ours, it’s important to communicate with it. It’s good for the cells to live in obedience to laws of the organ, and the organ to the organism. He discusses the time scale. Being integral to the planet means flowing into the planet. The speeding of time is not healthy for the planet. He questions how we can collaborate with the world at its best pace. He illustrates and explains Figure Ground Reversal. Religions arise from a ground-- something happens in the global plain-- every tradition says this. Each time this happens the figure religion steps out of its ground. Judaism is ground for Christianity, Buddhism from Hinduism. Each phase is a further development. He discusses synchronism. Take religions, mix them together and make one religion. People who have had a primary experience are not afraid of this. The more we share, the more we’re sharing one mind together. He references Ken Wilbur. What are the transformative and translated values of religion? Much is translation but both are needed. What are the tools to make us experience what we need? Each religion has roots to the land and Earth. It is necessary to consult ecology.  We need elements that come from the Earth to interact with the Earth. We don’t have the brain cells of a global brain—we need synaptic connections and greater connectivity. Historically, religions haven’t wanted to have anything to do with each other. But dialog is needed to connect with one another. We need this dialogue between religions. We need devoutness—to know how to use liturgy and contemplative tools. We must exchange information. There’s something pulling us to greater consciousness and greater connectivity.","","Religions","LCNAF","Time","LCNAF","Earth (Planet)","LCNAF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Moving image","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi Collection","Special Collections, Archives & Preservation, University of Colorado Boulder","Local","","Boulder (Colo.)","LCNAF","","","Schachter-Shalomi, Zalman, 1924-2014","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

"","narv_zalman_135_16_rabbiZalmanSchacterNoonLectureSeries021898_a.mp4","","Rabbi Zalman Schacter Noon Lecture Series","Reb Zelman is introduced. He discusses how religions are affected by the new cosmology. He talks about time. We don’t pay much attention to the textures of time. The flow of shared and inhabited time has speeded up vital processes. The sympathetic nervous system process, where we live under the pressure of time has speeded up. The parasympathetic process, where we spend our rest, and sleep, restores us again. Today, time for this has been diminished, and we need to spend more time in this process. Time has many dimensions, but we only experience the present. We must think in ways where time is not as rigid, and attune to different time zones of awareness. There’s a different dimensionality of time from a galactic point of view, from a transpersonal perspective. Something is calling us from the future. If we would tune in to what calls us, it would be a way to handle a little of that time deficit. He discusses religions affected by the new cosmology and the challenges of theologies. Some reality maps may clash with fundamentalists. He discusses his own past belief in world creation chronology. This is happening in all religions. By what process do they update their reality map and values? How do religions keep their identities and deal with this change? There’s no room for this in rigid hierarchies. We must move from mechanistic point of view. God is within, not outside of us. Our awareness keeps growing and is a better way to know God. What’s going on behind my mind, in my awareness? Who’s minding the mind? The deeper we are, the less is it mental and more an essential way of being. In looking for God on the outside we lose the awareness that is within us and is accessible to us. We can get to a place where we can deal with time. We can find moments of eternity to refresh ourselves from that maelstrom of time disturbed.

Reb Zalman reads various passages from a text in Hebrew, translates it to English, sings and leads chants. The subject matter is diverse. He says the mind wants to go to place of meaningful connection, and accompanied by insight, it is wonderful, as it results in other knowledge. We have many insights, but they disappear very fast. The beginner’s mind lights up like lightening but if there isn’t preparation it disappears. Insights don’t stay with us, and most times, minds have no way of wrapping around information. The study of Cabala here is important, it offers possibilities. He talks of mindfulness and looking at meditation from the Vipassana point of view of emptying the mind. We are bombarded by so much stimuli that when you’re in a pressure situation it’s easier to fill the mind than empty the mind. When you add conscious content, i.e. adding words to hymns-- it allows us to remember and to connect again to that experience. He wants to see more of this process in meditation. He discusses diversity, and that we need to remember individual differences. Many have identified with Judaism and its rules. Some lived by the rules, stopped, but want to come back. Give them the tools to make the connection again. He says everything is for the whole sake of God. God is an atheist. God doesn’t have a god. The grand sense of awe is important. With a personal approach to God, the heart connects. He asks the audience to do an exercise. Everyone pairs up, keeps eye contact for 5 minutes, and talks about the morning meeting. They keep contact with God for 5 minutes. The audience tells of their experiences. Every time we do something we give a gift to God. All doing is in the presence of God. We should know God, but it isn’t a depth of understanding. We’re not asking deep philosophical questions. Just recognize that we live in an environment that is God.","","Judaism","LCSH","Pastoral counseling (Judaism)","LCSH","God--Knowableness","LCSH","Mindfulness (Psychology)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Moving image","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi Collection","Special Collections, Archives & Preservation, University of Colorado Boulder","Local","","","","","","Schachter-Shalomi, Zalman, 1924-2014","","","","","","","","","","","","","Merchants of Vision Inc.","","","","","","","","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

He begins to address long term care in the U.S. and the pain of seeing what is and what ought to be. He has great faith in workers, what the system does to workers and to people in the system—it’s very far away to what it ought to be. He maintains we’ve lost touch with different kinds of living, i.e.n “being” as children and “doing” as adults. If you believe you are adult forever, then you must maintain a pretense-- a life based on doing. As decades pass, it gets harder to maintain pretense of doing as an adult. The 1.6 million people in nursing homes could not keep up with adulthood. Society has made 17 thousand nursing homes because we misunderstood old age. We thought people should be adults forever. We looked at what they can’t do, not what they could be. What if our elders begin to teach us how to be? He maintains we must help society remake a new elderhood-- to redefine the later adulthood of life. Elderhood is rich in potential, opportunity for peacemaking, and storytelling—a crucial element of social conservation. He then discusses the Eden Alternative and Green Houses, Shabbaz and Shabazene, gives examples and describes one of the present models operating in Mississippi.","","Older people","LCSH","Aging","LCSH","Nursing homes--United States","LCSH","Long-term care facilities--United States","LCSH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Moving image","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi Collection","Special Collections, Archives & Preservation, University of Colorado Boulder","Local","","Boulder (Colo.)"," LCNAF","","","Thomas, William H., 1959-","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

She discusses the positives and negatives for children brought up with a single, dual or no religion.  She says there are no formulas for deciding the best scenario, and maintains that a child should be given a tradition so they can later shun the label and engage in “god wrestling.” She says we need to recover our roots and our lost layers of identity. Children need to know who they are, their lineage and the customs of their ancestors.  This helps them to form a spiritual identity, context and appreciation of the world.  She discusses how to show children rituals that bind the family and cultivate their spirit roots. She gives examples of impromptu praying, giving thanks, telling stories, and family projects.  

Rev. Jay Rock is introduced. He tells his story of growing up in an interfaith family. He maintains that accepting dual heritages and cultures does not need to lead to confusion, but can contribute to a healthy development and sharpened view of the world.

Rabbi Zalman mentions that students need to hear content in a transformative way. He says the work of people who teach is to raise people up-- he calls it up-leveling, i.e. teaching your subject as if it came from above. He says make room for inspiration, i.e. going off your topic if deflected by ""sparks."" You must become transparent and see yourself in the presence of God. The ""carrier wave of love"" makes it possible for teaching to be absorbed. He gives an exercise to combat the ego/persona of the person to open the heart. From this place you begin to teach.

"","narv_zalman_135_33_creatingOurJewishFutureThursdayDaytimeTimecodeWindowBurnTape1_a.mp4","","Creating Our Jewish Future (Thursday Daytime) - Timecode window burn - Tape #1 ","The second day of Our Jewish Future. Rabbi Irwin Kula introduced. He discusses contextualism and pluralism. He says everything is context dependent. We interpret the world based on context. The essential problem of the human planet today is pluralism. The average Jew is looking for meaning, connection and community. We’re afraid of diversity-- anything that’s not unity makes us nervous. The non-orthodox Jewish community needs affirmation. Liberal Jews have a fragility of identity— an insecurity and fear that their Judaism will not live to the next generation. How do you have a body politic of pluralists that includes non-pluralists? We must have room for and hear the voice of all different fringes of Jews. Divisions are within all religions. The line can only be crossed by imagining the other perspective. Pluralism differs from diversity. It is not about compromise. It’s not relativism. It’s a passion, a commitment plus openness. We need to provoke more conversations, dialogue across the various Jewish sects. We need to learn to argue. There is a moment of silence. The film shifts to individual workshops with rabbis. Rabbi Firestone asks her group to stand in shoes of others and welcome non-pluralists. We need to tolerate, include and make room for non-pluralists in our camp. She shares a list of teachings about pluralism; everyone reads one teaching. She asks the group for insights, challenges. Several other workshops led by rabbis are shown. Rabbi Joseph Telushkin is introduced. He discusses the importance of words and the underrating of their significance. The Bible underscores that words are tangible. He talks about speaking unfairly about others and to others. People are victims of this. They have been hurt by what was said to them. He discusses the temper of parents and growing up with this; and those who have problem with temper. No one can hurt you as much as those that come from who knows you best. Many families don’t forgive and forget. There is a need to reconcile within families. We should be merciful in our families.","","Jewish renewal","LCSH","Judaism","LCSH","Religious pluralism","LCSH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Moving image","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi Collection","Special Collections, Archives & Preservation, University of Colorado Boulder","Local","","Boulder (Colo.)","LCNAF","","","Kula, Irwin","","Firestone, Tirzah","","Telushkin, Joseph, 1948-","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

There are 3 speakers, and classroom groups on this tape. The first speaker Rabbi Joseph Telushkin discusses anger, rage, relationships, and speaking well of others. He says many divorces are the result of worn out love due to cruel language. Anger is destructive and people believe what is said in anger. Anger is not a rational emotion, and we act irrationally. So we need to learn mechanisms to monitor it. Anger is sometimes justified, but often times it’s expressed disproportionally to the infraction. He maintains it is not unhealthy to suppress anger. Also, we should restrict an expression of anger to the issue that provoked it. He says people destroy relationships, but they have control over anger. He goes on to discuss gossip, rumors, slander, and negative untruths. He says when someone becomes associated with negative information, they become that association. We have no right to destroy reputation, and if we have anger we should proceed cautiously. He gives guidelines to help in criticizing. He asks audience to go 24 hours without saying anything unkind about anyone. He asks for audience questions (audience inaudible).  Reb Zalman comes to the stage and speaks on this topic relative to karma and reincarnation. There’s inertia in karma, one good deed brings on another. There’s no way to get out of karma, it reinforces itself. He then discusses renewal and a new understanding. Our soul knows about how we should live and behave, but most times it doesn’t add up to tradition. We’re creating a new tradition, and we must share it with one another. Prayer time and a break follows. There are smaller classroom groups led by rabbis on the film. Rabbi Irwin Kula takes the stage and discusses Jewish renewal. He talks about the changes in Boulder, the challenges of being a teacher in town, and the emerging Talmud. He says we’re living a paradigm shift. We don’t know how to articulate what it feels like yet. We must search for oneness. Paradigm change means you don’t know the next step. You leap into the abyss. We don’t know what right Jewishness is for tomorrow. It’s pathless, and every day is a new acceptance-- a turning from externals to a returning home. Go into yourself. Return home to your innermost life. Do it together, and we’ll be blessed as one. The talk ends with Rabbi Kula leading singing and chanting in a circle.","","Jews--Social life and customs","LCSH","Anger","LCSH","Karma","LCSH","Jewish renewal","LCSH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Moving image","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi Collection","Special Collections, Archives & Preservation, University of Colorado Boulder","Local","","Boulder (Colo.)","LCNAF","","","Telushkin, Joseph, 1948-","","Schachter-Shalomi, Zalman, 1924-2014","","Kula, Irwin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

It begins with showing outdoor activity: instrumental music and attendees socializing. Speakers and the community came together to discuss the planning of a new 30 acre campus of the Boulder Jewish Community Center. Some of the speakers comment on what it means to be a Jew in the 21st century, and how pleased they are that this is happening in Boulder. It seems the majority of Jews are not comfortable in the old paradigm. Boulder is an open environment yet there are challenges to be faced. Inside the UMC the first speaker is Rabi Tirzah Firestone. She talked of pulling down fences and crossing barriers. The community of Boulder is blessed-- Boulder rabbis have a fellowship and meet regularly. There is comradery here and the Jewish community offers cross denominational services for those in need. She offers a Challah blessing and leads a chant. Rabbi Joseph Telushkin talks about Jewish history and how they’ve made progress, but not ethical improvement. He says moral imagination is needed and gives a number of examples on how to cultivate it. Rabbi Irwin Kula speaks. Rabbis treat each other with respect in Boulder and this sets the tone for a hopeful experience in taking down boundaries. He discusses how to teach about being Jewish. He talks about marginal and peripheral Jews. Most Jews who tried to transform Jewish life had to leave Jewish life to do it. Gentiles in this community are needed; across history they have always come to Jewish observances. This is not a private club, but a wisdom tradition to be brought to the world. We need to widen definitions and widen boundaries.  He discusses Rosh Hashanah, the birthday of world. It is not about ownership abut out building human community. We need to open boundaries to anyone who wants to participate. The moderator discusses the new Boulder Jewish Community Foundation, The Boulder JCC, creating creating a Boulder Jewish campus on 31 acres, and building a home for the Jews of Boulder. He mentions needing help from the Jews of Boulder, and the fund raising efforts today.","","Future life, Judaism","LCSH","Jewish community centers--Colorado--Boulder","LCSH","Jews--Social life and customs","LCSH","JCC Association","LCNAF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Moving image","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi Collection","Special Collections, Archives & Preservation, University of Colorado Boulder","Local","","Boulder (Colo.)","LCNAF","","","Firestone, Tirzah","","Telushkin, Joseph, 1948-","","Kula, Irwin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

"","narv_zalman_135_37_ourJewishFuture_a.mp4","","Our Jewish Future","The conference is assembled to discuss the new Jewish Community Center in Boulder and to explore a deeper meaning of mystical Judaism. He speakers are: Rabbis Tirzah Firestone, Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, and Irwin Kula. Rabbi Tirzah talks about a fear-based ideology which has caused many to leave the faith. Many left to seek higher spiritual grounds, or marry out of the faith. She feels hopeful of bringing authentic meaning to the next generation in this new community. She believes Boulder can be the forerunner of a new Judaism. Living in proximity to natural beauty, divinity is all around us. God fills this place. Experiences of awe affect us, and challenge us. We want to explore many ways of being Jewish. Imagine a Judaism affected by the natural world. If there is anywhere in U.S. where we can live this vision, it’s here in Boulder. Reb Zalman agrees. Yes, nature is the full revelation of God. He relates that what’s happening is the action of the god Shiva; but instead of destruction to think of him as the recycler. It helps to understand why things are breaking down. Historically, various maps of reality had to be scrapped and replaced with others. When you can’t stretch the old paradigm any more it needs to die, hence a paradigm shift. We should be optimistic, not anxious. He gives examples of this with organismic systems. He talks about a restoration to spirituality, a healing process, a connection to ancestors, a collaboration, and what he’d like to see in the community– a humanistic Judaism. Rabbi Irwin Kula talks about his Jewish upbringing. He talks about Jews getting hurt, and about how everyone can experience themselves as most loved. He suggests that everyone try to find what in Jewish life they most find distasteful—and think the opposite. Imagine the insight that would result. He talks about the healing that Jews need to do, the history of being hated, and resulting PTSD. He talks of the past: developing boundaries, self-hate, and an ideology that lets one demonize the other. Healing is necessary to re-own tradition on our own terms. We must widen the definitions of Judaism. We have too narrow a frame of how people mark their own Jewishness. Why are some not experiencing spirituality in Jewish tradition? What kind of connection do we have? We must ask ourselves, what in my life is most alive?","","Jewish renewal","LCSH","Jewish community centers","LCSH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Moving image","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi Collection","Special Collections, Archives & Preservation, University of Colorado Boulder","Local","","Boulder (Colo.)","LCNAF","","","Schachter-Shalomi, Zalman, 1924-2014","Presenter","Firestone, Tirzah","","Kula, Irwin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

He talks of the infinite and finite world, the 2 names of God, God and the God Head, and that we need a filter between the two. Sukkot brings in satisfaction– the bliss and joy that fills one with goodness and beauty. He then elaborates on the days of creation related to chakras and biblical prophets.

He goes on to mention the concept of “I live,” and gives examples of how elders can live deliberately, come to terms with mortality, journaling process, and imaginative exercises. He quotes Jung in the causes of depression and the road not taken. In his own life, his failures turned out to be the “roots” of his successes. So this is a time to figure out how life had meaning within a philosophical framework—thereby creating safe and sacred places. He goes on to discuss spiritual intimacy, reconciliation, forgiveness, and past anxieties relative to the purpose and meaning of life.

He read Aldous Huxley's ""Doors of Perception,"" which was pivotal in his desire to experience other levels of consciousness. He describes meeting Timothy Leary at Harvard and his subsequent ""experiences"" with Leary. He discusses the importance of the homework done afterword. Ultimately one has to prep, digest and do contemplative work after the experience. Quotations from Martin Buber, Ram Dass, Aldous Huxley and Abraham Maslow are recounted.

Beauty, goodness and truth all have a connection to the heart. When truth touches your heart, you become engaged. He follows with a definition of beauty and aesthetics, beauty of character, and moral beauty. Another chant ensues: “Oh God beautiful, oh God so beautiful.” The Rabbi continues, saying we have a hunger for beauty in our lives, and when we experience it, it pays off in endorphins and relaxes anger, anxiety, etc. He discusses art vs. ordinary experiences. He says beauty demands that it should be shared but it needs to have the balance of truth or it could be perverse. He relates the 3 faces of God: truth, goodness and beauty. He concludes with an exercise to outwardly project beauty.","","Aesthetics","LCSH","God--Beauty","LCSH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Moving image","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi Collection","Special Collections, Archives & Preservation, University of Colorado Boulder","Local","","Boulder (Colo.)","LCNAF","","","Schachter-Shalomi, Zalman, 1924-2014","Presenter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Naropa Institute","","","","","","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

He stresses there are places where all religions are represented, and that they are all intrinsic and necessary for the totality of the planet. He takes olive oil and touches the symbols on the altar. There are various singers and instrumentalists, and more chanting in several languages. Ma Jaya speaks of largeness of the Rabbi’s God, and that every religion is represented here. Finally there is a ceremony in a boat with flowers and fire.","","Green, Ethel","Local","Memorials","LCSH","Hindu chants","LCSH","Interfaith worship","LCSH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Moving image","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi Collection","Special Collections, Archives & Preservation, University of Colorado Boulder","Local","","Sebastina (Fla.)","LCNAF","","","Unidentified creator","","Jaya Sati Bhagavati, Ma","","Kashi Ashram","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

He begins by asking: Why do so many Jews abandon their faith, especially those who are seeking spirituality? Why is there such a lack of understanding of and appreciation of Jewish mysticism? He states that t is alarming and disturbing at how few Jews are living Jewish lives. He says in the 60’s and 70’s many stopped going to synagogue as people had a spiritual longing. They felt they had no other options but to seek out gurus. Some explored and came back. He discusses oral tradition and broken esoteric lineages. He talks about the lives of Jews who are prominent Buddhists.

Ibrahim and Reb Zalman light a candle and meet in friendship. Both make statements of faith in Yiddish and Arabic. The Rabbi points out that they both have the same religious, cultural, and social issues. He states there is one God-- true oneness. Ibrahim says we cannot change the issues in the Middle Ease but we can build bridges here, by initiating dialog. We cannot have peace if there is disequilibrium—as long as we harbor hate, dislike or bigotry, one cannot become an ambassador for peace. Once we achieve peace within ourselves we can translate it to the environment around us. We are all cousins of different descendants. Reb Zalman concurs and elaborates on his statement—and they both believe that creating peace here may have an effect globally.","","Peace","LCSH","Judaism--Relations--Islam","LCSH","Islam--Relations--Judaism","LCSH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Moving image","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi Collection","Special Collections, Archives & Preservation, University of Colorado Boulder","Local","","Boulder (Colo.)","LCNAF","","","Schachter-Shalomi, Zalman, 1924-2014","Presenter","Kazerooni, Ibrahim","","","","","","","","","","","","","Colorado Chautauqua Association","","","","","","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

We’ve isolated ourselves from the pain of others. Ram Dass says some don’t want to use their pain to awaken. When faith gets stronger dying into the sea of suffering is possible. Zalman talks of the “36 necessary people” and how they are needed today. Ram asks him if his identity has changed since Vienna. He talks of his time then and his identity over the years. He discusses how renewal came about and those with Jewish background seeking a higher consciousness, and how changes came about. Zalman is asked to talk about his mentor and how he reconciles discrepancies between himself and his mentor. He talks of taking the baton, yet being uniquely himself. He feels inside, that he is not responsible for anything else but that. He feels his mentor witnessing his unique expression of dealing with compassion, mercy, tenderness, love, emptiness, and the like.","","Cooperation--Religious aspects","LCSH","Death","LCSH","Jewish renewal","LCSH","Spirituality","LCSH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Moving image","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi Collection","Special Collections, Archives & Preservation, University of Colorado Boulder","Local","","","","","","Schachter-Shalomi, Zalman, 1924-2014","Presenter","Ram Dass","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

When you pay the shadow costs you restore equilibrium. Zalman then sings in Yiddish and chants from the scrolls. There are prayers for the dead and group members read from the Torah.  He talks of the 7 days of creation and the lower Sefirots. More readings from the Torah ensue. Zalman talks of the therapies and job of the therapist in breaking through a sudden opening, inserting a wedge in that nanosecond. He relates this to Hokhmah; helping and healing at this moment of truth. He discusses Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Yom Kippur is Keter--how to forgive.  What karma we would build up if we didn’t have this day. After Yom Kippur, we start again from fresh. After a break he instructs the group to break up in groups of 7, to have conversations as role of the Sefirot as if you’re the representative. Zalman sings and plays small organ type instrument. He talks of the 7 days of Sukkot, and there is a reading and Hassidic interpretation. He talks of dimensions and parameters of Sefirot, and doing Kabbala for corporate teams. Zalman relates the functions of a space ship to the 10 attributes of Sefirot. He discusses binary and ternary forms to business models. He discusses the social philosophical issues that come out of Sefirot. Each one brings dominant function so they will blend. He talks of creating coalitions. He gives the example of the 4th day of creation and the luminaries. The moon makes itself smaller to accommodate the sun. Two kings must share one crown. It’s the same way with religious parties. He proposes the use of Sefirot to solve political, social, philosophical issues. Here’s a language, apply it, ask what can you contribute? Perform your dominant function.

He talks about the colors and vowels related to Sefirot. He instructs the group in movement, and they move in various slow dances in a circle to solemn music. He discusses telepathy, and dancing on the inside vs. outside. He then instructs the group to take any sentence or phrase in Hebrew or English and begin to repeat it. He asks group to put energy and intensity into this, then add movement and gesture, and to further engage in someone else’s harmony. Now do it as a love offering to God. Finally take over the prayer for the whole planet, for Hesed. The group chants with movement, then reads passages and prayers. He instructs another activity—to form groups of 7. Each person chooses one of the lower 7 Sefirot. He asks them to tune in to the awareness and wisdom which is not the individual, but the group mind.

Rabbi Zalman and the audience chant in groups, and act out the tree of life. Members read passages, offer intentions and prayers and chant alternately. Zalman prays to turn around all negativity. He passes around a “talking stick” and instructs the group to reflect or focus on davenening, Sefirot, etc. Members share their thoughts and sentiments, witnessing to each other. Zalman discusses the definitions of words and interpretations in Sefirot and Genesis, and traces history from animal sacrifices to verbal prayer, and to mindfulness. He talks about the 4 worlds In Sefirot. He discusses external and internal realities, good and evil, parodies, and shadow costs.  He says we must talk “to” the living God. He says we have sundered one aspect of God for another. But all we know of good and evil is in one God. He creates everything, including evil. He creates light and darkness. Evil has a function in the universe. If God is good why is there evil? Evil that is instrumental lets us see different situations. There’s no negativity that doesn’t have utility. Zalman illustrates and discusses various ways to look at the 10 Sefirot. He talks about a middle projection, long or short, linear, or one on top of the other, a foreshortened view. He gives the group homework.  He instructs them to bring back a model of the 10 Sefirot in a 3 dimensional way. What does it look like from the inside? How would you engineer that? So everything on the tree remains integral but see how you can integrate being in a space that we can inhabit. He then talks about the ideal synagogue and integrating the 10 Sefirot into the architecture. In building an agency for Jewish renewal, he says to imagine the synagogue as a pilgrimage place. It starts at the place where we enter into the world. We could see back to origin of species. We absolve our ancestors. He describes other passages of Sefirot likening them to the Stations of the Cross. Finally, Zalman directs the group to chant, make their way up to Keter and give each other blessings. The group chants and moves about and embrace each other.

He begins with humming a melody, then asking the group to hum, followed by singing with words. He begins by saying that as Jews, we don’t engage in enough dialogue with fundamentalists. He says it’s important for us to have good strong dialog in faith, and that being born again doesn’t belong to one tradition. Jews committed in faith should have a connection with all people who have faith. He discusses Hebrew words, roots, meanings, an how to use words in the masculine and feminine. He talks of the experience of prayer, and asks, is it the praying that brings this out or is it just a universal feeling? He discusses what happens in prayer or songs as vehicles. With verbal prayer-- to speak is to take a lesser form of communication. Sometimes prayer in word form takes you away from relating to God. The question of using of Hebrew vs. English in practice is discussed. How much of work should we do in Hebrew? There is a difference of opinion. Meaning is important. Something is transmitted through the word. What is the holy word in Hebrew? Discussions ensue of how much Hebrew should be used. He asks this of those coming from other traditions. He wants the vibrations that come with Hebrew. Are there certain chords within us that responds to the written tradition? When you’re in a tradition the original language may open you up to that tradition. The group discusses their experiences with reading and chanting in various languages. Zalman asks participants to imagine that the rest of their religious lives would be in Judaism only. He asks them to arrange in groups of triads where 2 people discuss, and 1 person records for 5 minutes. The groups then report on their discussions. He then asks the group to perform the same exercise but ask: Is prayer that necessary in your life that you program it as a high priority? Groups are formed in triads again to discuss this question. The groups report on their discussions. Zalman ends the session with asking everyone to do Daven.and ","","Prayer--Judaism","LCSH","Sefirot (Cabala)","LCSH","Spirituality","LCSH","Jewish chants","LCSH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Moving image","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi Collection","Special Collections, Archives & Preservation, University of Colorado Boulder","Local","","","","","","Schachter-Shalomi, Zalman, 1924-2014","Presenter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

He instructs the group to form a physical tree, and to make sounds in various tones. He says every holy day contains something of the other. He points out the various holidays and explains the relationship between them.  He begins with the months and goes through the year, and relates the holidays to sounds and chanting. He instructs the group in chanting and singing sounds. The group sings and moves in a circle. They progress through the calendar and continue to act out the holidays. He discusses the 12 months of year and 12 permutations of the divine name. He talks about every month having a different name, and that we must understand the months and time as it passes. God must have an interface-- that is a divine name.  Every year a new name needs to appear.  Every time we sin we pierce the name of God. When Yom Kippur arrives, the old name is so pierced that God has to discard it. To bring about atonement, we pray to the new name. This is the day when karma gets canceled. It’s the regenerative power in the world. He talks about the level of words and numbers, God names and the covenant of the 13 attributes of mercy. By saying them, God forgives. When the divine name arrives, a vessel must be made. At the equinoxes we thank God for the seasons. He talks about the rhythm of the seasons and the holidays, and the month of Marcheshvan, when there are no holidays and we can reorganize. He talks about Hanukkah, Purim, and the full moon, and a cyclical point of view. He discusses counting Sefirot 49 times, and how doing this reveals the issue at hand. You work up questions in the 49 Sefirot days for which you need a revelation. He discusses the 3 rings in the Holy Land and the day of the death of Abraham. He asks, What if we were to get together with Christians, Muslims and pray-- what a holy thing this would be.  He recalls a time when he went to visit Abraham’s grave and describes his interactions with the keeper of the grave, and recounts the story.","","Sefirot (Cabala)","LCSH","Fasts and feasts--Judaism","LCSH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Moving image","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi Collection","Special Collections, Archives & Preservation, University of Colorado Boulder","Local","","","","","","Schachter-Shalomi, Zalman, 1924-2014","Presenter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

Generally a panic reaction occurs at the time and a restructuring is needed. He discusses good v. evil in his mode of the 4 worlds. He discusses the masks, or permutations of God and accepts them all. He discusses people having holy experiences but most often not accepted by traditional churches, and that Jewish Renewal makes room for new breakthroughs. He goes on to discuss the growth part of God, Godding, and creation. He says God is process, a dance between creator and creating. He goes on with concepts of sacred sexuality, the Godding of God. Finally he addresses women, feminism, and the feminine aspect of God.","","Schachter-Shalomi, Zalman, 1924-2014","LCNAF","God","LCSH","Paradigm (Theory of knowledge)","LCSH","Heresy","LCSH","Jewish renewal","LCSH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Moving image","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi Collection","Special Collections, Archives & Preservation, University of Colorado Boulder","Local","","","","","","Schachter-Shalomi, Zalman, 1924-2014","Presenter","","","","","","","","","","","","ITT-Dow Jones Television","","","","","","","","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

The audio for Eve Ilsen was not audible, so is not reviewed. Reb Zalman begins with guiding participants in chanting and singing. One of the ways to gain blessings for good intentions is being in union with one another, in lifting our voices. He discusses the need for elders in our society. He says we have made progress in the elder arena but our progress lacks wisdom. Elders are creating sageing centers to come to terms with their mortality. He asks: what makes you sad about dying? It is the right time for something. When something is in right time we’re in the flow. When we have yielded to the way life wants us to go, it is surrendering to divine providence. He says eldering is badly needed. In the past, we didn’t have good models for a complete life. In sageing you live out the contemplative part of your life. In the Fall season of life you learn how to harvest life, and give back. Mentoring is important at this time. With sageing you’re going with the flow. He says there are tools are for this. One tool is social meditation, talking and sharing with each other; that is, spiritual intimacy—recognizing spirit in the other person. Regarding wisdom-- you can learn it, and acquire it. The best learning we do is from our mistakes. Wisdom is gained from experience, and experience is gained from our failures. He talks about opening up the heart and of consciousness. We should share what happens to us. It creates a sacred bond. He discusses letting go at the end of life, which is important to spiritual eldering. The awareness that death can be a friend-- can be helpful. He says that meditating in certain places enables transformative cognition. In order to do inner work we should go to a sacred place. A sanctuary is the best kind of contemplative place. In a comfortable place, we can carve out an inner space, a place filled with compassion. When we don’t know what we’re thinking or feeling, socialized meditation is useful. He advises shared meditation, to have partners. He instructs the group to pair up and leads them in an exercise.","","Older people","LCSH","Spirituality","LCSH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Moving image","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi Collection","Special Collections, Archives & Preservation, University of Colorado Boulder","Local","","","","","","Schachter-Shalomi, Zalman, 1924-2014","Presenter","","","","","","","","","","","","Spiritual Eldering Institute","","","","","","","","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

He says some statements in the Bible cannot be taken literally, but should be treated like poetry, figuratively, or connotationally. He mentions instances that are allegorical, parables. The Bible is filled with commentary and some things cannot be translated. The stories have a mysterious level of interpretation; that of imagination and grace. He says the Cabalists go deeper into this in the book of Zohar. When the Catholic mass was celebrated in Latin, certain parts were chanted. Chants are very important with connotational language. The way words are chanted tells us if we should apply them literally or in another fashion. Melody also tells a great deal. By reducing things to a tone we already speak, they lose their meaning. Words can mean more than one thing. The Rabbi reads passages of Genesis and discusses possible translations and allegories. Before the existence of the alphabet, a syllabic system existed, i.e. cuneiforms utilizing 350 symbols. This system was difficult to learn, and people who could read it were often seen as sorcerers, magicians. Stories in the oral bible not the same as those in print. He talks of early biblical lineage and sibling rivalry. He tells the story of Joseph and his coat of many colors. He points out that the biblical sibling rivalry shows us how difficult it is to partner, not as dominance, but steering together. The story tells of how deeply important it is to work together. He tells of other biblical stories and their meaning.","","Bible--Allegorical interpretations","LCSH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Moving image","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi Collection","Special Collections, Archives & Preservation, University of Colorado Boulder","Local","","Boulder (Colo.)","LCNAF","","","Schachter-Shalomi, Zalman, 1924-2014","Presenter","Ilsen, Eve","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

He asks: what should go into the graduate school we are dreaming about? He proposes getting every spiritual cookbook and trying the recipes. Try to create shortcuts and better initiations-- to come out with a catalog of doable spiritualties to be explored by individuals and groups. For example, using the modalities of dance, poetics, environmental science, color, incense or pheromones, hypnotherapy and invoking mantras that draw you to the holy arc.

He talks about pain and suffering and the element of needing pain. Eve Ilsen then gives a technique for feeling pain, thanking that feeling, and sending blessings in. Zalman talks about spirituality, dementia and depression. For depressions of despair, instead of trying to get out of it, we need to touch the bottom to get back up. He says going into the deep gives you a chance to rise. We should feel sorry for ourselves-- bring the petition to God in experiencing sorrow. Two other speakers read text and poetry. The group forms a circle and Zeb leads in singing and clapping to a song. Zeb discusses centering prayer, spiritual eldering and how to receive blessings. He talks of the Zen Peacemaker Order and Roshi Bernie Glassman. The group forms a circle and Zalman instructs them to share good intentions. Learning to bless one another will allow the part that’s the “sage” in you will come alive and get activated","","Aging","LCSH","Older people","LCSH","Spirituality","LCSH","Death","LCSH","Prayer","LCSH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Moving image","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi Collection","Special Collections, Archives & Preservation, University of Colorado Boulder","Local","","Boulder (Colo.)","LCNAF","","","Schachter-Shalomi, Zalman, 1924-2014","Presenter","Ilsen, Eve","","","","","","","","","","","Flashback Video Production ","","","","","","","","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

"","narv_zalman_137_24_spiritualElderingRebZalmanAkronOh_a.mp4","","Spiritual Eldering Reb Zalman in Akron , OH","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi is introduced. He starts by distinguishing those who are old vs. those who are elders. He talks of attunement. One being can create vibration in another; if one vibrates the other will start. The function of creating enthusiasm and energizing one another is so powerful. This helps us to become elders. He talks of learning how to pray from a praying person, in the presence of someone who vibrates, of that which is divine. As a divine being in a living body, we get divinized. Spiritual intimacy conversations is a process that turns people from merely aging to sages. We’re habituated not to look at mortality, protecting life at any cost, until it doesn’t work anymore-- when the body starts shutting down. In later life we must make peace with mortality. This opens up looking at the rest of life, a whole vista of life yet to be. There are no models here that a person spent time harvesting what their life was all about by ordering it, considering it, getting meaning out of their own life story. Making peace with it ends up an arena of work that people can do with their futures. We must sit and think over what it was all about, and put the light of consciousness over one’s life. It’s never too late. The greatest joy is to mentor a younger person. The ability to give counsel is a special gift, to be present when they talk of their hopes and dreams. We need to create new models to give feedback to the next generation. He suggests starting the skills you need to become an elder- meditation, how to make amends, and fixing things of the past. You must understand the function of your life regarding the planet, or it will be hard to say goodbye without feeling cheated. You must do philosophical homework. You must see part of yourself as a cell of the global life; that you fed back to the planet. He talks of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, her work and near death experiences. We should become aware of this and talk about it, i.e. sharing with an entity not in the body. We need to leave a heritage, and look back and say we’ve completed that which we came to do. Questions from the audience are then taken. The session ends with Zalman leading singing in English and Hebrew. An instrumental group plays and dancing is encouraged.","","Older people","LCSH","Spirituality","","Aging","LCSH","Mentoring","LCSH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Moving image","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi Collection","Special Collections, Archives & Preservation, University of Colorado Boulder","Local","","Akron (Ohio)","LCNAF","","","Schachter-Shalomi, Zalman, 1924-2014","Presenter","","","","","","","","","","","","#REF!","","","","","","","","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

"","narv_zalman_137_2_rebZalman_a.mp4","","Reb Zalman ","Rabbi Schacter-Shalomi is interviewed and discusses integrity in eldering. When a person elders, there’s an echo—a sense that all warring parts make peace; wisdom is the result and it provides a sense of calming. To achieve integrity, one must achieve an internal sense of being part of the global brain, offering an awareness of the universe which integrates with that of all other beings. Integrity in relationships can be a celebration of mutual forgiveness and letting go. He talks of December work and preparing for one’s passing. He reviews death rituals of the past and discusses the inner work of the dying person; how one can retain integrity yet dis-identifying with the body. This integrity gives consolation in knowing the fruit of one’s existence is given back to the universe. He discusses the importance of trans-denominationalism in eldering, and that every religion & species is needed for survival. The work of the elder is to serve with that mindfulness, and every tradition has images, words and tools which could help in this work. He sings a prayer, then discusses various angels and demonic beings. In eldering, one should accept the powers of being which are being offered.","","Integrity","LCSH","Older people","LCSH","Aging","LCSH","Death","LCSH","Angels","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Moving image","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi Collection","Special Collections, Archives & Preservation, University of Colorado Boulder","Local","","","","","","Schachter-Shalomi, Zalman, 1924-2014","Presenter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

Without forgiveness, eldering work cannot be done. He explains that in forgiveness work, one must start with simple as opposed to global issues. When you have unforgiveness you create an armor around it. Forgiving is a sense of letting go—a release of energy. He describes 3 stages: a simple “excuse me,” taking the opposition to see what it’s like, and atonement—becoming one again. He then recites the forgiveness prayer. He goes on to discuss eldering work and the eldering spirit.","","Older people","LCSH","Forgiveness","LCSH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Moving image","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi Collection","Special Collections, Archives & Preservation, University of Colorado Boulder","Local","","","","","","Schachter-Shalomi, Zalman, 1924-2014","Presenter","","","","","","","","","","","","Unidentified publisher","","","","","","","","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

"","narv_zalman_137_5_closingPanelTimeForSpiritVideoSeries_a.mp4","","A Time for Spirit: 3rd Annual Conference on Conscious Aging","The film is of the closing panel and ceremony of the 3rd Annual Conference on Conscious Aging. Ram Dass introduces a panel of 6 and they all comment on what participants should take from the conference. Ram Dass says: Aging is a unique stage of life with its own curriculum, not a continuity of what life was. It’s a time to use experience as a vehicle to work on spirit and growth. A part of you is the living spirit that is just present. Not moving, growing, or diminishing—it just is. We must cultivate that place; from there the dance of aging is very different dance. The time of aging should be used to work on one’s consciousness. Keep an open awareness to be able to dance through age and death. Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi says: Make an allocation of time and space that you will give to this work. To keep motivation in a right place he suggests doing outreach. Make a list of conscious maintenance. Ask what the body and the mind need, and raise your ecstasy count. Make note of your peak life experiences. This will turn to gratefulness. Do forgiveness work. Lighten your load, it will give you joy. Lilias Folan says: There is constant renewal and many ways to renew the body, mind and spirit. Take time for this each day. Take gratitude home. Soften your heart each day. Have gratitude for small things. Breathe gratitude and love into the heart. Rev. Matthew Fox says: Aging is a special opportunity for elders to do the spiritual work of nurturing the divine seed that is in all of us. One way is by the voluntary simplifying of our lives. It’s no too late to start over. We must connect to joy again. When souls and lifestyles are simplified-- joy comes in. And by that our species can reinvent itself in the world. Baba Olatunji talks of his upbringing in a Nigerian village. What you become is the sum total of everyone around you. He is always at home. One spirit rules the whole universe. He says: become an irresistible force against an immovable object. Only spirit is what we are. That’s an assurance, as when you have it you don’t need to be afraid. Judith Duerk: Take home the silence that came between the elder circles and sharings. That time gave us a chance to soak in each thing that was said. Feel the deep sense of quiet and space in between things. Let it make sense of itself in terms of your own life. Just hold it quietly in your hearts. Let the weekend filter into yourselves, and let it slowly speak its truth to you. Audience questions are then taken. The 2nd conscious aging award ceremony is bestowed to Baba Olatunji for his contributions to conscious aging. Each of the panelists displays one final ceremonial act. Chanting, yoga, mindfulness and drumming lead the audience in participation.","","Aging","LCSH","Spirituality","LCSH","Older people","LCSH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Moving image","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi Collection","Special Collections, Archives & Preservation, University of Colorado Boulder","Local","","Atlanta (Ga.)","LCNAF","","","Ram Dass","LCNAF","Schachter-Shalomi, Zalman, 1924-2014","","Folan, Lilias M.

First Rabbi Shacthter-Shalomi discusses Y2K and the opportunities we have to start anew. He says we can’t expand into the next millennium unless we leave the old behind. We should start with the Zen Beginner’s Mind and ask what’s impacting us from the future, and that we should be ready for whatever’s calling us. We should work for the life of the planet, as the ego is running rampant, we’re consuming our resources, not living in harmony with it. We must let go of our selfness. If we become aware of the moving force in the life of the planet we become better partners in the process. He discusses a new program at Naropa—The Center for Engaged Spirituality. The most crucial question for us is: can we find the unified field theory for something to which everyone can have a vital connection? Much data are available for calibrating the optimal function of planetary life. We must work organically together to become agents of the healing of earth. We must surrender our minds to change our minds, and address the earth mind to learn its priorities. What would our spiritual states need to be to become agents of this? Engaged spirituality recalibrates minds to operate in the most functional way. To change the mind, surrender the mind to the greater mind of earth, to serve the purpose of the planet. In this applied spirituality center we’ll ask: What is the most optimal for the human spirit and harmony, and what is most connected with the intent of the earth? In the 2nd lecture Dee Joy Coulter discusses child development and neuropsychology in wartime vs. peacetime. Her concern is that half of children on the planet are growing up in wartime conditions. She asks: How can we bring peace to these kids? In peacetime upbringing the child is able to access the heart easily and relax. She discusses the vagal nerve pathway and the stages of child brain development and sensory processes. Throughout these stages the child is laying a foundation for mental life. She talks about what interferes in the learning process, in creating healthy social beings and the survival process. She further talks of chronic stressors, those highly susceptible, indirect trauma, impulse control and resilience.","","Spirituality","LCSH","Consciousnes","LCSH","Year 2000 date conversion (Computer systems)","LCSH","Earth (Planet)","LCSH","Pediatric neuropsychology","LCSH","","","Child development","LCSH","","","","","","","","","","","Moving image","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi Collection","Special Collections, Archives & Preservation, University of Colorado Boulder","Local","","Boulder (Colo.)","LCNAF","","","Schachter-Shalomi, Zalman, 1924-2014","Presenter","Coulter, Dee Joy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

The first, in recognition of World AIDS Day, 1994, begins with a ceremony of 19 chimes. A panel of four discuss their experiences with AIDS, either having the disease or working in the AIDS community. They discuss how the AIDS community are our elders, help with the dying, extending generosity and wisdom in extreme and painful circumstances, humor and creativity. Grassroots development of organizations is recounted. Dying in Africa and cultural differences in native communities is presented by one speaker. Medicines in South Africa are discussed. Questions and comment from the audience ensue and a moment of silence is held. The 2nd talk is with Zalman Schacter-Shalomi (59:48). He discusses the new millennium, alternative healing methods and eco-psychology. He says we are victims of our imaginations, and that we don’t steer imagination. We imagine the worst, and have to steer ourselves out of difficult imagination.  He talks about various lineages and traditions having certain myths and that these shared visions bring in the positive outlooks. He gives examples from biology and sports for placing good intention and steering good outcomes. He talks of how with collaboration we can further outcomes with more intensity in the new millennium. He talks about thinking with the heart, not with the head, taking hold of the positive and pushing it. He asks the class what world change they would like to make and to take some time to envision it.

Class fourteen continues with a discussion of the Ishbitzer Rebbe, his son, Reb Ya'akov of Ishbitz, and the ""Renewal"" ways of his grandson, Reb Gershon Henokh of Radzyn. Schachter-Shalomi then turns to look at Hasidism and politics in the 20th Century, Rav Avraham Yitzhak Kook's view of secular Jews in Israel, and Hasidism and the Industrial Revolution. This is followed by an introduction to Reb Ahrele Roth (he also tells of meetings with Erich Neumann and Gershom Scholem) and his ""mitzvot of the heart,"" his mystical intentions (kavvanot), and his prayer. Then Reb Kalonymous Kalmisch of Piasetzno is mentioned briefly before moving on to Reb Hillel Zeitlin, the Neo-Hasidic forerunner of Jewish Renewal. After this, there is a short discussion of Hasidic publishing after the Holocaust. He then goes on to answer questions about the relationship between Hasidism and Renewal, Renewal Judaism and outreach work, and the question of Uganda and Israel.

In this continuation of class fourteen, Schachter-Shalomi continues answering questions on the relationship between Hasidism and Existentialism, and on Renewal in relation to the Lubavitcher Rebbe. He reflects on Hasidism as it is presented in the films the students have watched and talks about Hasidic spiritual guidance for individual types, as well as Hasidic spirituality for women. He then discusses the differing concept of the Tzaddik in the teachings of Reb Shneur Zalman of Liadi and Rebbe Nahman of Bratzlav, and tells stories of his friend, Reb Gedaliah Kenig of Jerusalem, a Bratzlav manhig, 'leader.'
